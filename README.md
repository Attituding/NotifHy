# Project Status
NotifHy was made before Hypixel clearly defined the rules of their API. Now, this bot violates the rules established at https://api.hypixel.net/. For this reason, this project has been (somewhat) abandoned, and no more features will be added. The public bot that once hosted an instance of NotifHy has been deleted. Contact Attituding at [attituding@outlook.com](mailto:attituding@outlook.com "attituding@outlook.com") if you have any questions.

As a side note, if you decide to use some of this code, please note that many parts of this bot are designed terribly. Good luck.

## Introduction
NotifHy is a bot focused on alerts and notifications for the Hypixel server. Share logins with friends, get reminders when you are about to lose your daily reward streak, and get alerts on suspicious activity.
